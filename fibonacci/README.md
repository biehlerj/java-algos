# Find `nth` number in Fibonacci sequence

For this exercise I chose the `Nth` Power of Matrix approach.

## Performance

### Iterative approach

Time Complexity: $O(n)$
Auxiliary Space: $O(1)$

### Recursive approach

Time Complexity: Exponential
Auxiliary Space: $O(n)$

### Dynamic Programming approach

Time Complexity: $O(n)$
Auxiliary Space: $O(n)$

### `Nth` Power of Matrix approach

Time Complexity: $O(log\ n)$
Auxiliary Space: $O(log\ n)$ including function call stack size else $O(1)$
